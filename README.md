## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexboxes

### What I learned

What I learned from this project is the intricacies of styling with CSS. Purely styling a website with CSS and not relying on pre-built, pre-stylized elements was a rewarding challenge. I usually wouldn't implement the styles in the index file but for this project it seemed easier to do this than separate the files for this size of a project.

Understanding flexboxes and how to best utilize it for this project was fun to tackle. When I first started this project I was having difficulty understanding flexboxes but this project gave me a better grasp on it. I played a fun little game called Flexbox Froggy recommended to me by a professor which helped me instantly in getting a better understanding of flexboxes. Flexboxes are a great tool that I will add to my toolbox for future projects. 

This snippet of code was for aligning the whole blog card to the center of the page.
.page {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
    }


This snippet of code was for handling the image inside of the blog card.
.blogCardIMG {
      margin: 8%;
      border: 0px solid white;
      border-radius: 10px;
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
    }

### Continued development

In future projects I will try to tackle understanding of flexboxes more and how to utilize it to position elements to different parts of a webpage. Also, for projects of larger size, I will be separating the styles into its own file rather than combining it into the index.
